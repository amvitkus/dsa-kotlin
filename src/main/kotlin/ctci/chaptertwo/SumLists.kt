// You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in
// reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. In Kotlin, write a function that adds the two
// numbers and returns the sum as a linked list. Not allowed to just convert the linked list to an integer.
